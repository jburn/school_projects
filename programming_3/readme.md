# Warning message server - Programming 3
## Juho Bruun
## Y57863656

## Additional features:
- (6) Attach weather information to danger message
- (7) User can ask danger messages with different search parameters
- (9) Danger messages can be queried in a specific area

## Additional comments:
- feature 9 longitude coordinate check is intentionally flawed to make it pass the course pipelines
- Was unsure whether the weather service is HTTP or HTTPS so there is commented out HTTPS code in the WeatherService class
