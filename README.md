# school_projects
*Projects and code from university courses*

**software_project:** Developed a non-secure android app for security testing and education for the university. Link to repo: https://github.com/Mikkeep/namaste

**internet_of_things:** Implemented a weather station that gathers data by using an arduino with temperature sensors and sends it wirelessly to a local pc where it generates graphic data from the temperature reading history. Link to repo: https://github.com/pintti/iiootee

**computer_systems:** Turned a TI Sensortag device into a game controller that uses gyro to detect motion and sends appropriate messages to screen and the game. Also plays music.
                  Folder includes the Y86-assembly exercise, which is basically a pseudo random number generator using the middle square -method.
                  
**data_structures_and_algorithms:** Course assignment for DSA using python. It implements a Graph data structure and applies Kruskal's algorithm and BFS to find the path with the lowest maximum weight in a given graph.

**elementary_programming:** Minesweeper implemented using pyglet in Python. First programming assignment ever done by me.

**programming_1:** Included the course assignment and a simple member registry database made while learning to use structs. Both are made in C.
                  ATM simulator reads account number from filename and PIN code from corresponding file.
                  Also reads and writes balance and account events from/into text files "bal.txt" and "events.txt".

**programming_2:** Course assignments for the course about the basics of Object Oriented Programming using Java.

**programming_3:** Course assignment for the course about HTTPS server programming. Implemented using Java.

**programming_4:** Simple python GUI-application for file and string encryption using PyQT5. Made in collaboration with another student.
