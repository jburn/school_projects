*Random projects and code from university courses and free time*

**computer_systems:** Turned a TI Sensortag device into a game controller that uses gyro to detect motion and sends appropriate messages to screen and the game. Also plays music.
                  Folder includes the Y86-assembly exercise, which is basically a pseudo random number generator using the middle square -method.
                  
**data_structures_and_algorithms:** Course assignment **WIP** for TRA using python. Finds the path with the lowest maximum weight.

**pocket_calculator:** A simple calculator with a graphical interface that can add, subtract, multiply, divide and also raise to the power of any number.
                   No known bugs. Code is far from efficient but works.

**programming_1:** Included the course assignment and a simple member registry database made while learning to use structs.
                  ATM simulator reads account number from filename and PIN code from corresponding file.
                  Also reads and writes balance and account events from/into text files "bal.txt" and "events.txt".
